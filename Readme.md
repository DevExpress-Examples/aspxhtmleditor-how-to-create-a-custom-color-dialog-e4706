# ASPxHtmlEditor - How to create a custom color dialog


<p>This example demonstrates how to embed a custom color dialog instead of the standard one to support selection of custom back and fore colors. The ASPxHtmlEditor allows you to define custom buttons within its toolbars. There two custom buttons are created and placed instead of standard buttons. One of them changes the background color, the other - changes the font color. The Bootstrap ColorpickerÂ library is used to provide a color dialog.</p>
